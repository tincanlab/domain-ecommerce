# DOMAIN

Domain architecture repo entrypoint. Owns domain design baselines and produces a job catalog for developer routing.

## Read First

1. This file - domain context and navigation

## Parent

- [ENTERPRISE](https://github.com/tincanlab/ea-repo/blob/main/ENTERPRISE.md)

If enterprise level is absent in your organization, replace with `Not applicable`.

## Critical File Contract

- Keep required section headings from this template.
- Do not rename or delete required sections.
- Keep this file concise: identity, routing semantics, and links.
- Put detailed/mutable operational values in canonical artifacts and link them here.
- If a required section has no content, keep it and write `Not applicable`.

## Canonical Artifacts

- `implementation-catalog.yml` (canonical work-item/API routing selector; optional `implementation-catalog.json` compatibility projection)
- `architecture/domains/<domain>/*.yml` (domain design, component specs, data/workflow details)
- `inputs/workstreams/<WORKSTREAM_ID>/source.yml` + `artifacts/` (upstream handoff provenance and payloads)

## Routing

`WORK_ITEM_ID` (or `API_ID`) -> `implementation-catalog.yml` -> implementation target

## Upstream Inputs

- Prefer `inputs/workstreams/<WORKSTREAM_ID>/` because `WORKSTREAM_ID` is the
  selector/routing key for DA startup.
- `source.yml` identifies upstream repo URL + commit/tag + captured_at + reason,
  and should include `solution_key`, `initiative_id`, `workstream_id`, and
  `handoff_ref` when available.
- Keep only current upstream feed in each workstream folder; use Git history
  for prior states unless explicit snapshot/version folders are later required.

## Policy

- Treat selector inputs as authoritative (`WORK_ITEM_ID`, `WORK_ITEM_ID`).
- Fail-closed on inactive status by default.
